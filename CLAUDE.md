# factorio-planner

## Running

```bash
npx tsx src/cli.ts <command>
```

No build step needed for dev. The 16MB prototype JSON loads in ~0.6 seconds.

## Key files

- `src/cli.ts` — CLI entry point (commander)
- `src/solver/MatrixSolver.ts` — production solver (matrix construction, algebraic + simplex solvers, constraint handling)
- `src/solver/ModuleEffects.ts` — module/beacon effect computation
- `src/solver/types.ts` — solver input/output types
- `src/data/PrototypeLoader.ts` — prototype JSON loader + recipe/factory/tech indexes
- `src/export/helmod.ts` — Helmod import string export (Lua serializer + zlib + base64)
- `src/commands/solve.ts` — solve command (target/input modes, factory/module/beacon/fuel overrides)
- `src/commands/recipes.ts` — recipe query commands (--produces, --consumes, --unlocked)
- `src/commands/techs.ts` — technology lookup (--unlocks)
- `data/helmod-web-prototypes.json` — all recipe/entity/item/force/technology data (16MB, exported from Factorio)
- `export-mod/` — Factorio mod that dumps prototype + force + technology data to JSON

## Solver notes

- Native TypeScript solver (no Lua dependency)
- Items produced by one recipe and consumed by another in the same block are classified as intermediates (state=0) and linked internally
- **Algebraic solver**: Multi-pass Gaussian elimination. Default for target mode. Supports `--constraint` (master/exclude). Breaks on large chains (12+ recipes — gives astronomical numbers).
- **Simplex solver**: Linear programming. Default for input mode. Supports `--constraint exclude` (zeroes out production coefficients in working copy). Handles complex chains with competing consumers. Always use simplex for blocks with many recipes.
- Input mode defaults to simplex because algebraic greedy pass can't balance competing consumers
- Module/beacon effects computed and exposed via `--modules` and `--beacons` CLI flags
- Fuel consumption modeled in matrix: burner factories consume fuel and produce `burnt_result` (e.g., coal→ash). This creates automatic intermediate linking but can cause degenerate scaling — prefer electric factories or use exclude constraints.
- `--constraint "recipe:product:exclude"` prevents a recipe's byproduct from driving solver scaling (works in both algebraic and simplex)
- `--max-import "item:amount"` caps how much of an item can be imported. `amount=0` forces full internal production. Post-processing pass scales up producer/consumer recipes to close balance gaps, cascading deficits to raw materials. Works with both solver modes.
- Helmod export reverses recipe order (output recipe first) to match Helmod's top-to-bottom processing

## Prototype data quirks

- `entity.energy_usage` is in **J/tick** (not watts). Multiply by 60 to get watts (J/s). This matters for fuel consumption calculation.
- Some recipes have `products: {}` (empty object) instead of `[]` — handle with `Array.isArray()` check
- Recipe categories `barreling`, `unbarreling`, `recycling` are filtered from the producer index
- In Pyanodon, ALL vanilla assembling-machines (1/2/3) are burners (have `burner_prototype`). Use `automated-factory-mk01/02` (electric) or `advanced-foundry-mk01` (electric, smelting) to avoid burnt-result coupling.
- Entity quality fields (`crafting_speed` etc.) are objects keyed by quality name: `{ normal: 1, uncommon: 1.3, ... }`
- Module effects are per-quality: `item.module_effects.normal.speed`
- Coal `burnt_result` is ash (Pyanodon-specific). Solver models this — stone furnaces burning coal auto-produce ash as intermediate.
- Force data (`force.recipes`) tracks unlock state per recipe. Technology data tracks researched techs and their recipe unlocks.

## Helmod export format

Pipeline: `luaSerialize(model)` → `zlib.deflateSync()` → `base64` — **NO version byte prefix**.

- Factorio's `helpers.encode_string()` returns `base64(zlib(data))` without a "0" prefix. The "0" prefix is blueprint-string-specific, not used by Helmod.
- Helmod's `Converter.read()` passes the string directly to `helpers.decode_string()`, then `loadstring()` on the result.
- `ModelBuilder.copyModel()` reconstructs the model. It validates recipe names against game prototypes — they must be real recipes.
- Key fields read by `copyFactory()`: `name`, `quality`, `fuel`, `modules`, `module_priority`
- Input constraints go in `block_root.ingredients` with `{name, type, input=amount}`. Target constraints go in `block_root.products`.
- For input mode: `by_product=false, by_factory=false`. `by_factory=true` is a separate mode (fixed factory count) that skips reading `.input` values.
- Export reverses recipe order so output recipe is R1 (index 0), matching Helmod's top-to-bottom algebraic solver.

## TODO

- [ ] `--electric` / `--no-burner`: auto-select best electric (non-burner) factory per recipe
- [ ] `--recipe-tree <item>`: trace full ingredient tree showing all recipe options with unlock status
- [x] Multi-input constraints: support multiple `--input` flags simultaneously
- [x] `--max-import`: cap intermediate imports, force internal production
- [ ] Temperature-linked fluids: conversion rows for fluids at different temperatures (steam 165C vs 250C vs 500C)
